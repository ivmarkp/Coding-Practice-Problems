# Coding Practice Problems
## Classical
Some "must-know-how-to-solve" problems (with their variants). Come up with solutions better that naive ones.
 1. Fibonacci Numbers  
  a. Given a number n, print the Fibonacci sequence upto n.  
  b. Find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.  
  c. Given a Fibonacci number, print its index.  
  d. Check if a given number is Fibonacci number.  
  e. Given a number n, find number of digits in the nâ€™th Fibonacci number.  
 2. LCM, GCD  
  a. Given two numbers, find LCM & GCD.  
  b. Given an array of n numbers, find LCM & GCD.
 3. Factorial  
  a. Find the factorial of a large number.  
  b. Count Factorial numbers in a given range.  
  c. Count the number of digits in the nth Factorial number.  
  d. Given an integer n, count the no. of trailing zeroes in its Factorial.
 4. Palindrome  
  a. Check whether a string is a palindrome using pointers.  
  b. Check whether a number is a palindrome with recursion.  
  c. Given a number, print the next smallest palindrome.  
  d. Given a string, print the longest substring (not subsequence) which is palindrome.  
  e. Given a string, print all possible substrings that are palindrome.
 5. Prime number  
  a. Check whether a given no. is prime in better time complexity than O(n).  
  b. Print all prime factorization of a given number.
