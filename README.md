# Coding Practice Problems
## Classical
Some "must-know-how-to-solve" problems (with their variants). Come up with solutions better that naive ones.
 1. Fibonacci Numbers
- Given a number n, print the Fibonacci sequence upto n.
- Find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
- Given a Fibonacci number, print its index.
- Check if a given number is Fibonacci number.
- Given a number n, find number of digits in the nâ€™th Fibonacci number.
 2. LCM, GCD
- Given two numbers, find LCM & GCD.
- Given an array of n numbers, find LCM & GCD.
 3. Factorial
- Find the factorial of a large number.
- Count Factorial numbers in a given range.
- Count the number of digits in the nth Factorial number.
- Given an integer n, count the no. of trailing zeroes in its Factorial.
 4. Palindrome
- Check whether a string is a palindrome.
- Check whether a number is a palindrome.
- Given a number, print the next smallest palindrome.
- Given a string, print the longest substring (not subsequence) which is palindrome.
- Given a string, print all possible substrings that are palindrome.
 5. Prime number
- Check whether a given no. is prime in better time complexity than O(n).
- Print all prime factors of a given number.
